# Wolf-Goat-Cabbage-Problem
A solution to the Wolf-Goat-Cabbage Problem using a tree. The solution-finding algorithms to be implemented are BFS and Astar.

## Problem

A farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a container of cabbage are on the west bank of the river. On
the river is a boat in which the farmer and one of the other three (wolf, goat, or cabbage) can
fit. If the wolf is left alone with the goat, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat is left alone
with the container of cabbage, the goat will eat the cabbage. Your goal is to transfer everyone
to the other side of the river safely.

## Done

Created a tree to represent all possible states of the game

## To Implement

BFS search and A* search of the tree to find the optimal path to goal state
